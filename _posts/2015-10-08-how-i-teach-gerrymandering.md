title: How I Teach Gerrymandering
---

Cross-posting from the brand-new [MIT ESP](https://esp.mit.edu) [teacher blog](http://mitesp.tumblr.com): I wrote a [post](http://mitesp.tumblr.com/post/130793404248/how-i-teach-gerrymandering) about how I teach gerrymandering.  It of course starts with the famous cartoon.

I'm going to be teaching it again at Splash in November, so suggestions are always welcome!
