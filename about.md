Hello! I'm Ben Kraft (he/him), and this is my website.

I'm currently taking a break between jobs, after which I'll be looking for a new software engineering gig. (If you know of one I would like, please feel free to reach out, but please be aware I may not get back to you until I'm ready.)

By way of biographical snippets, I have:

* grown up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania
* worked as a software engineer, and before that a software engineering intern at [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org)
* graduated from MIT with an S.B. in (theoretical) math, and minors in physics and political science
* been involved with the [MIT Educational Studies Program](https://esp.mit.edu) and later its offshoot [Learning Unlimited](https://www.learningu.org)

You can also read my [resume](/files/resume.pdf), which is quite out of date, or ask me for an updated one.
