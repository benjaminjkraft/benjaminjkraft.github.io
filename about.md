Hello! I'm Ben Kraft (he/him), and this is my website.

I've been taking a break between jobs, and am now beginning to look for a new software engineering gig. If you know of one I would like (most importantly, one with great coworkers), please reach out!

By way of biographical snippets:

* I grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
* I was a software engineer, and before that a software engineering intern, at [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org).
* I graduated from MIT with an S.B. in math, and minors in physics and political science.
* I was previously involved with the [MIT Educational Studies Program](https://esp.mit.edu) and later its offshoot [Learning Unlimited](https://www.learningu.org).

My resume is available from this very website in [HTML](/resume/) and [PDF](/files/resume.pdf).
