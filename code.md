Below is a partial list of the (public) software projects I've worked on.  A more complete list is on my [Github](https://github.com/benjaminjkraft/).

### Genqlient

[Genqlient](https://github.com/Khan/genqlient) is a GraphQL client for Go which uses code generation to ensure the queries it makes are valid and correctly-typed. I wrote more about [why](https://blog.khanacademy.org/genqlient-a-truly-type-safe-go-graphql-client/) and [how](https://blog.khanacademy.org/where-go-and-graphql-collide-behind-the-curtain-with-genqlient/) we wrote it on the Khan engineering blog.

### Slicker

[Slicker](https://github.com/Khan/slicker) is a project I wrote for work to reorganize Python code.  You can read my [blog post](https://engineering.khanacademy.org/posts/slicker.htm) about it for more.  Sadly, I haven't found time to update it to Python 3, as Khan Academy [moved away from Python](https://blog.khanacademy.org/go-services-one-goliath-project/).

### Emojiwatch

[Emojiwatch](https://github.com/Khan/emojiwatch) is a Slack bot to notify you whenever someone adds a custom emoji.  Add it to your Slack and never miss an emoji again!

### ESP Website

I started contributing to the website of the [MIT Educational Studies Program](https://esp.mit.edu) in college, and continued to work on it for several years after.  It's [open-source](https://github.com/learning-unlimited/esp-website/) and used by chapters of [Learning Unlimited](https://learningu.org) across the country.  It's a complicated and terrifying mess, but it's also really useful (and getting less terrifying every day!).

### Venmo Security

For our group project for MIT [6.857](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/), [Eric Mannes](https://ericmann.es), [Jordan Moldow](https://github.com/jmoldow), and I tried to reverse-engineer [Venmo](https://venmo.com), a social payments app.  We found some interesting [security holes](/files/venmo.pdf) (which we sent to Venmo and they fixed).
