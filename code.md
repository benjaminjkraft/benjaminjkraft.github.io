Below is a partial list of the (public) software projects I've worked on.  [Github](//github.com/benjaminjkraft/) probably has a better memory than I do, though.

### ESP Website

Most of my coding energy for side projects goes into the website of the [MIT Educational Studies Program](//esp.mit.edu).  It's [open-source](//github.com/learning-unlimited/esp-website/) and used by chapters of [Learning Unlimited](//learningu.org) across the country.  It's a complicated and terrifying mess, but it's also really useful (and getting less terrifying every day!).

### zScore

Going to MIT, one ends up with a lot of friends who don't sleep enough.  It also happens that many of my friends are often a bit competitive about silly things.  So some friends and I made a [website](//zscore.mit.edu) to track your sleep and compare it to your friends'.  It looks like it was written in 2005, but you could [fix that](//github.com/sleepers-anonymous/zscore/).

### Venmo Security

For our group project for [6.857](//courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/), [Eric Mannes](//ericmann.es), [Jordan Moldow](//github.com/jmoldow), and I tried to reverse-engineer [Venmo](//venmo.com), a social payments app.  We found some interesting [security holes](/files/venmo.pdf) (which we sent to Venmo and they fixed).

### cosponsors

The [Sunlight Foundation](//sunlightfoundation.com) has some really cool APIs for data about Congress.  I made a [page](/cosponsors/) that uses their data to show cosponsorships in Congress.
