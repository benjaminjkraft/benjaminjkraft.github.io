Below is a partial list of the (public) software projects I've worked on.  [Github](https://github.com/benjaminjkraft/) probably has a better memory than I do, though.

### Slicker

[Slicker](https://github.com/Khan/slicker) is a project I wrote for work to reorganize Python code.  You can read my [blog post](https://engineering.khanacademy.org/posts/slicker.htm) about it for more.

### Emojiwatch

[Emojiwatch](https://github.com/Khan/emojiwatch) is a Slack bot to notify you whenever someone adds a custom emoji.

### ESP Website

I started contributing to the website of the [MIT Educational Studies Program](https://esp.mit.edu) in college, and I've kept poking at it since.  It's [open-source](https://github.com/learning-unlimited/esp-website/) and used by chapters of [Learning Unlimited](https://learningu.org) across the country.  It's a complicated and terrifying mess, but it's also really useful (and getting less terrifying every day!).

### zScore

Going to MIT, one ends up with a lot of friends who don't sleep enough.  It also happens that many of my friends are often a bit competitive about silly things.  So some friends and I made a [website](https://zscore.benkraft.org) to track your sleep and compare it to your friends'.  It looks like it was written in 2005, but you could [fix that](https://github.com/sleepers-anonymous/zscore/).

### Venmo Security

For our group project for [6.857](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/), [Eric Mannes](https://ericmann.es), [Jordan Moldow](https://github.com/jmoldow), and I tried to reverse-engineer [Venmo](https://venmo.com), a social payments app.  We found some interesting [security holes](/files/venmo.pdf) (which we sent to Venmo and they fixed).

### cosponsors

A page using [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com) API data to show [cosponsorships](https://github.com/benjaminjkraft/cosponsors) in Congress.  Now defunct as the API has been removed.
